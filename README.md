# Neural Networks Fundamentals Repository

This is a learning repository dedicated to the fundamentals of Neural Networks. Here, I will be uploading notebooks that explain key concepts both mathematically and with code.

## Notebooks
- ### Backpropagation:
  This notebook explains the backpropagation algorithm, a crucial method for training neural networks. It covers the mathematical principles behind it and provides code examples for better understanding.

## Getting Started
- Firstly, install the required libraries by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.  
- Secondly, run the .ipynb files and start learning with them.
