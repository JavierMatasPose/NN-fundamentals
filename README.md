# Report on Neural Networks Fundamentals Repository

This repository focuses on teaching the fundamentals of neural networks with an emphasis on backpropagation. The primary resource is a Jupyter notebook that explores mathematical principles and practical implementation through code.

## 1. Mathematical Foundations

### Functions and Derivatives
The notebook begins by defining functions like and computing their outputs at various points.

### Derivatives
Derivatives are introduced as the rate of change of a function at a given point. 

### Partial Derivatives and Gradients
The notebook extends derivatives to functions of multiple variables, introducing gradients. 

This concept is crucial for understanding how functions change concerning multiple variables.

### Chain Rule
The chain rule, a fundamental tool in calculus, is used to compute derivatives of composite functions. 

This rule is essential for backpropagation, enabling efficient computation of gradients in neural networks by breaking down complex functions into simpler operations.

## 2. Computational Graphs

The notebook introduces the `Value` class to represent nodes in a computational graph. Each node encapsulates:

- **Data**: The value it represents.
- **Children**: Input nodes or operations leading to this node.
- **Gradient**: Computed during backpropagation.
- **Label**: For identification purposes.

### Operations

The `Value` class overloads arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) to create a computation graph.

This allows constructing complex computations by combining basic operations.

### Example Computation Graph

Consider the expression \( x + y \times z \):

- Nodes: \( x \), \( y \), \( z \), multiplication node (\( y \times z \)), addition node.
- Edges represent data flow during computation.

This graph structure enables efficient gradient computation by propagating changes backward through dependencies.

## 3. Backpropagation Algorithm

### Overview
Backpropagation is an algorithm to compute gradients efficiently in neural networks using the chain rule. It involves:

1. **Forward Pass**: Compute the output of the network.
2. **Loss Calculation**: Determine the difference between predicted and actual outputs (loss).
3. **Backward Pass**: Propagate the loss gradient backward through the network to compute gradients for each parameter.

### Key Steps

- **Topological Sorting**: Process nodes in reverse order so that each node's gradient is computed only after all its dependencies.
- **Gradient Calculation**: Using the chain rule, compute gradients starting from the loss function and moving backward through operations.

This allows updating weights and biases to minimize the loss.

## 4. Visualization of Computation Graphs

The notebook uses `Graphviz` to visualize computational graphs. Functions like `trace(root)` gather nodes and edges, while `draw_dot(root)` generates a graph representation using the `Digraph` format.


## 5. PyTorch Integration

While not explicitly shown in the provided code, the repository likely integrates PyTorch for practical implementation. PyTorch provides automatic differentiation through its `autograd` package.

This demonstrates how PyTorch efficiently computes gradients, enabling quick implementation and experimentation with neural networks.

## Conclusion

The repository provides a comprehensive learning path from mathematical foundations to practical implementation:

1. **Mathematical Concepts**: Starts with functions, derivatives, partial derivatives, and the chain rule.
2. **Custom Class Implementation**: Builds computational graphs manually using the `Value` class for gradient computation.
3. **Backpropagation Algorithm**: Explains how gradients are computed efficiently in neural networks.
4. **Graph Visualization**: Uses tools like `Graphviz` to understand data flow and dependencies.

This structured approach equips learners with both theoretical understanding and practical skills, making it an excellent resource for mastering neural network fundamentals.
